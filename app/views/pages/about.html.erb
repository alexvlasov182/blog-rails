<h1>About page</h1>
<p>Passionate about developing technologies and development on the server-side.
  I have a little e-commerce experience in markup, but I have a great desire to work and learn. I spend all my free time practicing Ruby on Rails development.</p>

<p>I want to find a challenging and exciting project, that will allow me to apply and improve my skills and knowledge. In my spare time, I study the Golang language, I find it a very interesting language with static typing and fast compilation to bytecode.
  I also made these projects myself:</p>

<ul class="list-item">
  <li class="left">Simple http API server,</li>
  <li class="left">CRUD,</li>
  <li class="left">Creating cross-browser, semantic and valid code,</li>
  <li class="left">Developing and implement a grid system (Media queries, Bootstrap) for mobile responsiveness.</li>
</ul>
